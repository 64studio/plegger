The PiDeck Bootlegger is designed to record whenever audio is present on the default ALSA input device. It uses sox to record 192k MP3s and timestamp them. 

These files are made available through a web browser interface on a local wireless network to anyone with the WiFi password, which can then be uploaded to a sharing service such as Mixcloud.

Build with:

dpkg-buildpackage -aarmhf -I.git

Or:

1. Install dependencies manually. e.g. for Debian stretch which has node 4.7:

sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-mp3 dnsmasq hostapd nodejs wireless-tools

2. Or on Debian before stretch, install nodejs from 4.x branch:

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

3. Clone this repo:

git clone https://github.com/64studio/plegger.git

4. Add configs from the conf directory to their respective places:

sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
sudo cp conf/hostapd.conf /etc/hostapd/

5. Update the path for hostapd config in /etc/default/hostapd as follows:
	
DAEMON_CONF=/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf

6. Set a local domain in /etc/hosts
